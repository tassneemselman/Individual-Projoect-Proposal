    "I chose these variables because my research question directly deals with measurements of depression and social isolation with respect to my chosen subgroups (married women/men with kids). Since levels of depression and social isolation can vary, are not fixed, and are presently unkown, it only makes sense that they are my variables. Further, these datapoints (that I have alotted as my two variables) represent continuous data, and thus can be effectly modeled using 3 data visualization plots that I list later.   \n",

    "### (i) Justification for Each Visualization Type and Summary Statistic \n",
    "\n",
    "    a. Justification for Plots and Visualizations \n",
    "        \n",
    "1. Box plots are great for directly comparing the distributions of depression and loneliness scores between married women/men with kids. I'll create a box plot for each variable. If there are any skews in the data, which box plots effectively reveal, it could suggest differences in the experiences of social isolation and depression between women and men who are married with kids. However, I'll have to make note of any substantial sample size difference between my two subgroups since box plots don't indicate sample size. I would just add a caption noting this limitation. \n",
    "            \n",
    "2. Violin plots are very useful to capture multi-modality. If one subgroup is multimodal in their depression and loneliness scores, it provides an indicator that there's other subgroups within the data, which could reflect a variety of experiences.\n",
    "            \n",
    "3. Histograms would allow me to understand the spread and identify any outliers. If there's a wider spread of depression levels for married women than men, for example, then this would support the multimodality of the KDE plot by once again indicating a diversity or variability in their experiences. Further, if I wanted to bootstrap the data, a histogram would be necessary.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "Using all 3 data visualizations would be very useful for a comprehensive understanding of the data so I could answer my research question in an in-depth way. \n",
    "    \n",
    "     b. Justification for Summary Statistics \n",
    "        \n",
    "1. It's necessary for me to calculate the mean for each subgroup for depression and loneliness scores, respectively. A direct comparison of the means would reveal if one group has a tendency to score higher than the other. However, the mean can be less accurate if there's a skewness to the distribution. \n",
    "            \n",
    "            \n",
    "2. In the event that the distribution of depression and/or loneliness scores are skewed, it would be nice to calculate the median since it's less affected by outliers. \n",
    "            \n",
    "            \n",
    "3. Comparing standard deviations between married women/men for the two variables would allow me to get an understanding of whether or not one group has a greater variety of experiences with depression and loneliness than the other. The bigger s is, the greater the variability in scores is. \n",
    "            \n",
    "            \n",
    "4. The IQR will be very valuable to my analysis, in particular when it comes to calculating the CI and rejecting my null hypothesis using bootstrapping. The IQR is also less influenced by any potential outliers. \n",
